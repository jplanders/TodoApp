##This is a Todo list web application built using the MEAN stack.

To run this webapp on your machine, you will need to download the project as well as MongoDB.

The application is served by Node.js.  From a command line run 'mongod' to start the mongo database and 'node server' from another command promt to start the server.

When both the server and database are running open localhost:3000 in a web browser to utilize the application.

Type a task in the Task Name text box and click Add to add a new item to the Todo list.

When a new item is added, the Start Date field will be populated with the current date.

Items that are not complete will have a blank space for the End Date.

You can click the red End button to the right of a task to complete the item.  The End Date field will be populated with the current date.

To edit or delete an item from the list click the yellow Edit button.

The item will appear in the in the Task Name text box for editing.

The Add button will become hidden and an Update and Delete button will take its place.

You can either make a change to the item and click the blue Update button or click the red Delete button to remove the task from your list.

At the bottom of the Todo list app are three view options.

You can view all the tasks with the light blue All button, view only tasks that are not yet complete with the green Unfinished button, or view only tasks that you have completed with the red Finished button.
